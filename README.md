**How to check if package.json is up-to-date ?**

1. Check the package.json on that GitHub ( https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/package.json ) for Front-End related NPM modules
2. Check the package.json obtained by generating a project with `express myapp` for Back-End related NPM modules
3. Create a Locutus project and type `npm update --save` in Terminal, at the working directory, then use that package.json to watch for any change in versions
